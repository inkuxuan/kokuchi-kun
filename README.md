# vspc-bot

A Discord bot that schedules and posts VRChat group announcements via an emoji-based approval workflow.

**Announcement flow:**
1. User mentions the bot in a monitored channel → bot reacts with 👀
2. Admin adds 👍 to approve → AI extracts event details → announcement is queued
3. Bot posts a confirmation embed with ⏩ (post immediately) and 📅 (create calendar event) reactions
4. At the scheduled time → VRChat API posts the announcement to the group

## Setup

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
uv sync

Copy `.prd.env.template` to `.env` and fill in credentials (Discord token, VRChat username/password, OpenRouter API key).

## Run

```bash
python bot.py --env .env
```
